## My Weather App

Weather App Using Geolocation

Started this as a school project with 3 members in total. With 0% knowledge of React Native and Expo Go, we managed to create a mobile Android app that has a feature of current weather forecasts and access to major traffic near the user. This app is also using your geolocation to gather the current weather and traffic near you, with a user-friendly interface. We use the Google Maps API to make this project work.

## Features

- Geolocation-Based Weather Updates
- Current Weather and Forecasts
- Assess traffic conditions with road colors
- Intuitive User Interface
